### Project:  AeroCade

AeroCade is an In-Flight Entertainment app designed to keep users entertained during travels,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the core functionalities and features.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
 
### Ui Component

- **Ui Class:** Contains 6 methods that work with the other classes `Render.java` and `TimerTutorial.java`. These 
methods are extracted to display various types of messages and art. These include `greetUser()`, 
`quitUser()`, `printHelp()`, `printTTTTutorial()`, `printHangmanTutorial()`, and `println()`
  - `greetUser()` and `quitUser()` displays the greetings and _randomised_ farewells, including art.
  - `printHelp()` prints the descriptive help message.
  - `printTTTTutorial()` and `printHangmanTutorial()` displays a gameplay tutorial of each game, displaying a frame 
    every 4 seconds.
  -  `println()` is a simple and convenient method to call for other classes.


- **Render Class:** Contains all the art and messages that are called in `Ui.java`


- **TimerTutorial Class** Contains two display methods `displayTTTTutorial()` and `displayHangmanTutorial()` which 
displays every frame of the tutorial, and a schedule method `scheduleTutorialFrames(frames, interval)` is used to 
`run()` a frame every 4 seconds.
