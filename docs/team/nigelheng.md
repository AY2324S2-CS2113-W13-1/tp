### Project AeroCade

AeroCade is an In-Flight Entertainment app designed to keep users entertained during travels,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the core functionalities and features.

Written below are my contributions to this project.

**HangMan Class:**
This class extends from the parent `Game` class. HangMan consists of 2 methods overwritten from `Game`.
The HangMan class also consists of 4 methods that work with other classes in the project to help validate user input and direct exception handling.
runGame(), printLettersGuessed(), addGuess() & howToPlay().

* printLettersGuessed() iterates through and prints each element of the allLettersGuessed array.
* addGuess() is called for every valid input when the HangMan game is running, to check if the guess is correct or wrong.
* howToPlay() is called when the user inputs `guide` and prints a help guide for the HangMan game.
* runGame() is overwritten from the `game` class and starts the game of HangMan by asking what category of words to guess from, followed by asking for a user input till game completion.


**Enhancements to existing features:**
* updated code in Duke to ensure the main loop continues to request input when a game ends.
* added category feature to HangMan for users to pick between 4 categories of words to guess from
* added full word guessing feature to HangMan in addition to just letters.
